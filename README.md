# CandleLight.ino
Simulates a candlelight while brightness is smoothly raised and smoothly *or* rapidly reduced. Thus, even if the sketch is still simple, it is a little bit more complex than the very easy candlelight sketches.

#### Requirements

- ATtiny85 micro controller (or similar).
- Arduino IDE with ATTinyCore by Spence Conde.
- A programmer for the micro controller. You can use an Arduino Uno, Elegoo UNO (or similar).

#### Settings
- Set your ATtiny on 1 MHz (burn bootloader before uploading the sketch).

#### Real Life Example
